2. LaTeX equations are supported out of the box. The Markdown editor is extended with LaTeX equation and autocomplete.

## Installation

WaggyLabs should be installed as a typical Django app into the existing Django project. An example of such project can be found on the [WaggyLabs GitHub](https://github.com/naitsok/wagtail-waggylabs>) page. It is good to have basic understanting of [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.org/) and its configuration. Tested with latest Wagtail version.

Installation steps:

1. `pip install wagtail-waggylabs`

2. Make sure that the `INSALLED_APPS` variable in the `settings.base.py` contains the following apps

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        "waggylabs",
        
        "wagtail.contrib.forms",
        "wagtail.contrib.modeladmin",
        "wagtail.contrib.redirects",
        "wagtail.contrib.routable_page",
        "wagtail.contrib.settings",
        "wagtail.contrib.styleguide",
        "wagtail.contrib.table_block",
        "wagtail.embeds",
        "wagtail.sites",
        "wagtail.users",
        "wagtail.snippets",
        "wagtail.documents",
        "wagtail.images",
        "wagtail.search",
        "wagtail.admin",
        "wagtail",
        
        "modelcluster",
        "taggit",
        # "taggit_templatetags",
        "el_pagination",
        "wagtailmenus",
        "wagtailmarkdown",
        "wagtailmetadata",
        "hitcount",
        "captcha",
        
        "django.contrib.admin",
        "django.contrib.auth",
        "django.contrib.contenttypes",
        "django.contrib.sessions",
        "django.contrib.messages",
        "django.contrib.staticfiles",
        "django.contrib.sitemaps",
        
        # Other apps for the project
    ]
    ```

3. If needed, add `waggylabs.middleware.DjangoAdminAccessMiddleware` to the `MIDDLEWARE`. This middleware prevents opening `/django-admin/` if a user has not logged in through `Wagtail` login page.

4. Add `wagtail.contrib.settings.context_processors.settings` and `wagtailmenus.context_processors.wagtailmenus` to the `context_processors` list of `TEMPLATES`.

5. Configure `wagtailmarkdown`
   
    ```pyhton
    WAGTAILMARKDOWN = {
        # ...
        "allowed_tags": ["s"],
        "extensions": [
            "waggylabs.extensions.markdown",
            ],
        "extension_configs": {
            "codehilite": {
                "linenums": True,
                }
            },
        "extensions_settings_mode": "extend",
    }
    ```

6. Configure [django-simple-captcha](https://guide.wagtail.org/en-latest/) if you intend to use it. For example,

    ```python
    CAPTCHA_CHALLENGE_FUNCT = 'captcha.helpers.math_challenge'
    # CAPTCHA_IMAGE_SIZE = (120, 60)
    CAPTCHA_FONT_SIZE = 30
    ```

7. Include the WaggyLabs URLconf into your Django project

    ```python
    from wagtail import urls as wagtail_urls
    from waggylabs import urls as waggylabs_urls
    urlpatterns = [
        path("", include(waggylabs_urls)),
    ]
    if settings.DEBUG:
        from django.conf.urls.static import static
        from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns

        # Serve static and media files from development server
        urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()
        urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
    urlpatterns = urlpatterns + [
        # For anything not caught by a more specific rule above, hand over to
        # Wagtail's page serving mechanism. This should be the last pattern in
        # the list:
        path("", include(wagtail_urls)),
        # Alternatively, if you want Wagtail pages to be served from a subpath
        # of your site, rather than the site root:
        #    path("pages/", include(wagtail_urls)),
    ]
    ```

8. In order to properly initiazlie the django-hitcount with the demo homepage, the following set of commands in this order

    ```python
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

9.  Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` to be able to login to Wagtail admin.

10.  Start the development server `python manage.py runserver` and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or similar shown url in your browser to see the demo page. If you have configured `WAGGYLABS_BASE_URL`, then the demo page will appear at the http://127.0.0.1:8000/WAGGYLABS_BASE_URL/ url. To login to Wagtail admin, go to the http://127.0.0.1:8000/WAGGYLABS_BASE_URL/WAGGYLABS_WAGTAIL_ADMIN_BASE_URL/ url.

## Settings

There are few additional setting for the WaggyLabs in addition to the settings of the different packages used.

    ```python
    # WAGGYLABS_BASE_URL sets the base url for the whole WaggyLabs site
    # i.e. the total url will be WAGGYLABS_BASE_URL + all other parts
    # (For example, Django admin base url will be WAGGYLABS_BASE_URL +
    # WAGGYLABS_DJANGO_ADMIN_BASE_URL). This is needed when a WaggyLabs
    # site is added to an existing Django project.
    WAGGYLABS_BASE_URL = ''
    WAGGYLABS_DJANGO_ADMIN_BASE_URL = 'django-admin/'
    WAGGYLABS_WAGTAIL_ADMIN_BASE_URL = 'admin/'

    # Sets the default value for the main menu sublevels in the WaggyLabs site settings admin page. The value can be changed in the admin page.
    WAGGYLABS_MENU_MAX_LEVELS = 1
    # Controls the appearance of the menu item when its submenu opens. Again, this is the default value for the WaggyLabs site settings admin page and can be changed there
